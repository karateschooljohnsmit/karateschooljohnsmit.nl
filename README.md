> It's a website for our dutch karate school owned by John Smit Sensei, based in Enkhuizen.

## Quick Start

This project is based on 11ty using Stephanie Eckles' [5t3ph/smol-11ty-starter](https://github.com/5t3ph/smol-11ty-starter) template. For local development take the following steps.

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/karateschooljohnsmit/karateschooljohnsmit.nl.git`

2. Once cloned, run `npm install` to install 11ty. Then run `npm start` to run 11ty in `serve` mode which will create a local server including hot-reload.

3. Edit `index.md` to change the home page, and then create content within `src/pages` using any templating format you prefer to add content.

> Review the resources available at [11ty Rocks](https://11ty.rocks) to learn how to apply more customizations, including adding custom data sources and reviewing what template languages are available.
