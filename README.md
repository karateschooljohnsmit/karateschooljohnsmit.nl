## Collaborate on this website

This project is based on 11ty using Stephanie Eckles' [5t3ph/smol-11ty-starter](https://github.com/5t3ph/smol-11ty-starter) template. For local development or authoring content please take the following steps.

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/karateschooljohnsmit/karateschooljohnsmit.nl.git`

2. Once cloned, run `npm install` to install 11ty. Then run `npm start` to run 11ty in `serve` mode which will create a local server including hot-reload.

3. All content files are in the `src` folder. Edit `index.md` to change the home page, and create or change content within `src/pages` to change the other pages using markdown. Please put all images in the `src/img` folder.
   
5. If you know what you're doing and need to change the layout for this website look for our CSS files in the `src/css` folder and if you need to change the templates for pages or the menu structure you can take a look at the files in the `src/_data` and `src/_includes` folders.
